1
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:01,699
The third!

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:02,332
(Christoph claps)

3
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:05,431
Now that we have explained

4
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,264
how a two-bit adder works,

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,896
let's take the first step in reality.

6
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,262
But back to the video for a moment.

7
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:19,360
What we see is the AND gate.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,626
On the right we see the input A and B, where we can put numbers.

9
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:26,325
Any number can be zero or one.

10
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:29,024
In the middle is the coupling sheet in blue

11
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,390
that defines the logic.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,989
And on the left we have the clock sheet at the top, where the impulse comes,

13
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:41,754
and the output sheet at the bottom, where we then see the result

14
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:44,086
of the operation - the AND operation.

15
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,619
And here below, well known:

16
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,051
The truth table of the AND operation,

17
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,050
where you can basically see:

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,017
0 and 1 makes 0

19
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:55,183
0 and 1 makes 0

20
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:56,383
1 and 0 makes 0

21
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:59,148
and 1 and 1 makes 1.

22
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:05,080
And now we have moved to the next step and we now see the gates here.

23
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,645
The blue one is what we're looking at today, the AND gate.

24
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:13,811
And let's briefly demonstrate how it works.

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,443
So, now let's do it in parallel.

26
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,042
We'll show it shortly in front of...

27
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,607
In front of the picture here or here.

28
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:30,239
We now see two input sheets that protrude on the right.

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,571
If they're rightmost, it's zero when you slide it in...

30
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:38,803
If you slide one in, for example, that's the A now, it would be one.

31
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,768
But if you push the B in, then we have one for the B, exactly!

32
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:46,701
Then we have at the top, we have the impulse sheet,

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,533
where the clock comes in, and at the bottom we have the output sheet.

34
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:52,632
Exactly!

35
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:57,131
And now let's check the truth table to see if theory

36
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,197
agrees with reality.

37
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:03,662
So let's start with zero and zero...

38
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:07,261
makes the zero!

39
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,327
Zero and one...

40
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,360
makes zero!

41
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,559
One and zero...

42
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,092
equals zero!

43
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:21,790
And now comes one and one, makes one!

44
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,156
Perfect, works!

45
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:26,355
So, now...

46
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:29,554
we show the steps

47
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:32,420
how we got to this...

48
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,253
beautiful end result.

49
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:40,218
We used software from Siemens for this.

50
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:44,383
And we now see a half-finished

51
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:47,083
AND gate here, where two sheets are still missing.

52
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:50,548
We have one of the two input sheets on the right.

53
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:56,113
We have the clock sheet at the top and the output sheet is still missing at the bottom.

54
00:02:56,813 --> 00:03:00,578
We then parameterized it nicely and prepared it in advance

55
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:06,477
so that the models can then be printed in different scales.

56
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,176
It's like a model railway,

57
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,142
there's H0 and there's N scale.

58
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:13,675
And then we want to be able to make different sizes,

59
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:16,607
depending on the application we need it for.

60
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,306
And here we can now, for example...

61
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,372
turn the parameter "Screw" in particular,

62
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:26,171
i.e. for the screw, namely the diameter of the screw,

63
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,170
we now have five millimeters here.

64
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,436
And we can now, for example, double that to ten...

65
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:34,735
and then the model is also scaled at the same time here!

66
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:38,567
And then there is a standard format that is used there.

67
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,300
In our case, that's... What did we take?

68
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,465
3MF, all right!

69
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:50,130
And then the whole thing is imported into another program

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,729
that is then used for the 3D printer.

71
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,895
And then you can already see this part...

72
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:00,260
in the new program.

73
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,560
Looks almost the same!

74
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,792
And this is going to be here now...

75
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:06,892
This has special features

76
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:10,657
that are needed to actually 3D print this.

77
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:15,922
Now you had to turn that first, because here this...

78
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:20,021
This bridge (overhang), it was up before

79
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:23,420
and the 3D printer can't do that because it can only print 45 degrees.

80
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,119
So you have to turn it once, because then it's on a plate, and

81
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,652
we'll see it right away.

82
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:28,652
And...

83
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,551
What else do we have to do?

84
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,884
We had to rotate it...

85
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:35,916
Oh yes, then we duplicated these parts

86
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:36,883
because in the model

87
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:41,648
that we just saw earlier, we basically only had one input sheet.

88
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,780
And we only had the clock sheet and not the output sheet...

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,413
And that's why it was duplicated again!

90
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,145
And now you can see it in a different way.

91
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,278
Now you can see the different layers.

92
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,377
These wavy lines, that's the filling (infill), I think that's what it's called.

93
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:58,810
You could print that solidly, that is, completely.

94
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:02,109
But in order to save material and make it lighter,

95
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:06,274
some structures are printed that are responsible for stability.

96
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,740
And now you can go down here and then

97
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:15,205
see the different layers that the 3D printer then builds up accordingly from bottom to top.

98
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,904
This is now the bottom layer.

99
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:21,236
And then prints it from bottom to top.

100
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:25,068
It's going to take like half an hour, a good half hour,

101
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:28,367
36 minutes until it's finished.

102
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,567
What else we see here...

103
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:35,165
This is a built-in camera, where you can follow the printing process live.

104
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:38,364
So now let's go over to the 3D printer.

105
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,463
This is a homegrown 3D printer.

106
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:45,529
And what particularly fascinated me was, what I hadn't seen at first.

107
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:50,861
Some of it was already generated by a 3D printer.

108
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,526
So this print head, which we see here, has already been

109
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,192
printed out in large parts by another 3D printer.

110
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,391
Very briefly to the function: We have a plate down here

111
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:03,423
that is a bit heated.

112
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:07,822
Then here, of course, is the print head, where this material is

113
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,555
fed in or drawn in from above.

114
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:15,853
The upper part is called the extruder, because the material is pressed in here.

115
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:19,719
And there's a device downstairs where this is heated to make it liquid.

116
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,384
And then it can be applied here.

117
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:28,716
And you can now control this print head here in different directions, XY...

118
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:33,881
And the Z direction for the height, we then have that through the printing plate.

119
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:37,480
And then we just want to start the process now...

120
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:41,878
Then it starts...

121
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,441
So, now the printing plate moves up first...

122
00:06:56,008 --> 00:07:02,172
And then we use a pin like this to measure exactly how...

123
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,171
how high the printing plate is in different places.

124
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:10,570
The bright, transparent pin... yes, you can see it!

125
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:15,835
And now it's first measuring the topology of the plate,

126
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:21,866
because it seems to be very important that the first...

127
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,999
that the first area is printed cleanly, otherwise it won't work!

128
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:29,031
Ah yes, and now he's starting

129
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,863
to do some contours here.

130
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,195
And you can already see...

131
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:41,027
You can already see...

132
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,659
holes!

133
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,924
We print in blue.

134
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,489
For the end result, we also wanted to...

135
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,088
print the corresponding colors at some point,

136
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:04,320
but the material is just missing.

137
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,082
So the first layer is printed slower so it's quite clean.

138
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,114
And later it gives it a little more gas.

139
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,547
It's like the foundation, the foundation simply has to fit!

140
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,246
Otherwise the whole house is useless!

141
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:33,612
If it's not right below, then it won't work!

142
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:42,009
So, we now have here...

143
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,808
input sheet...

144
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,574
output sheet...

145
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,473
clock sheet...

146
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,539
Then comes the second input sheet...

147
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,472
So we have four of the same kind, more or less.

148
00:08:56,205 --> 00:09:00,437
Oh, by the way, what we forgot in the explanation earlier was the...

149
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:07,301
What is of course also necessary in addition to the sheets is the cage,

150
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:10,867
where we pack the whole thing, i.e. the housing for the...

151
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,333
switching element.

152
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,931
The question that is on my mind right now is:

153
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,663
where is the logic sheet or where is the coupling sheet?

154
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,196
That would have to come sometime later.

155
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,496
Ah yes, here it comes!

156
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,628
(Michael laughs)

157
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:32,727
Now comes the coupling sheet of the AND operation.

158
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:39,325
It's kept relatively simple with these two L-cutouts.

159
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:49,222
As a prototype, we didn't make these L-cutouts

160
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,354
completely symmetrical,

161
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:56,287
but slightly asymmetrical, so that...

162
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,052
if

163
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:02,851
the zero was... not quite correctly entered...

164
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,884
the result would still be zero!

165
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:13,282
We have a fan down here.

166
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:16,514
You can see him a bit here now.

167
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:21,912
It turns, this round part over there. Now you can see it a bit...

168
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:26,211
It ensures that the material cools down

169
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:32,876
so that it doesn't melt at the bottom. It has to solidify relatively quickly!

170
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,908
Here we have the filament, it's called it.

171
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:41,640
It's the material that's wound up in a roll like this.

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,706
And then is feeded from the extruder...

173
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,405
into the print head.

174
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,737
And below...

175
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,503
there's the part that's being heated.

176
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,967
And that's called "Hotend", where the material is then liquefied.
